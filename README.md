# Embedded_Systems_2
Like previously in Q1 and Q3 we were provided a lot of code.
## Q1 
We had to set a pacman sprite to be able to move around the screen with key prompts and not go off the photo. As pacman moved the spot he was last at was to be restored to the previous image. My code is denoted by having a TODO above it.
## Q2 
We had to explain the Clang output. All my work is in the .ost file
## Q3
Tracks is a dataset has peaks, valleys and follows the constraints of an increasing peak.
